## Overview üìÑ
This project was made using my [First_Webpage](https://github.com/Raziz1/First_Webpage) as the website to host. The python script is responsible for scrapping a bit of data for the website and writing to a text file(Not Relevant). The python script is also responsible for waking the Raspberry Pi (4) display and running the http server on a seperate thread.

 ## HTTP Server üåê
 *  Ensure that the python (.py) script is in the same folder as your html, css, and javascript files.
 *  You can run the python script or you can manually create a new host port in the terminal by typing `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (Python 2) or `python3 -m http.server 8000` (Python 3). Then in your browser type in `localhost:8000`.
 *  To close the server simple press `CTRL + C` in the Terminal window
 * [Serving Files with Python's SimpleHTTPServer Module](https://stackabuse.com/serving-files-with-pythons-simplehttpserver-module/) is a great resource if you need further instruction.
