## Overview 📄
This project was made using my [First_Webpage](https://github.com/Raziz1/First_Webpage) as the website to host. The python script is responsible for scrapping a bit of data for the website and writing to a text file. The python script is also responsible for waking the Raspberry Pi (4) display and running the http server on a seperate thread.
